# ML-Models

## Basic ML model - Linear regression 
Used when:
- Relationships are Linear or Approximately Linear
- Interpretability is vital for project
- Dataset is small to medium
- LR is a Baseline Model
- Theoretial Foundation Exists

## Intermediate ML Model (housing predictor) - Random Forest 
Used when:
- Complex, non-linear Relationships
- Large Datasets with many features
- Automatic Feature Selection
- Doesn't assume normal distribution
- Handles missing values better
- Less affected by outliers
- No need for feature scaling
